# Portfolio

_My first project and personal website where I show who I am, what I do, present my projects and provide my contacts_

Since September 2024 I have started my software development business as a freelancer. In fact, this site was created with the aim of informing my potential clients of the type of work I do and what kind of person I am. All this to help them understand if they want to rely on me to realize their ideas

## Website structure

The site is made up of 5 sections:

- **Home**: the first thing the user sees, a small summary of what I do and what I offer
- **Services**: here I go into more detail exploring my 3 main services
- **Portfolio**: this is the area that contains my most recent projects and works, provided with a short description and links that refer to the product
- **About me**: this is where I expose myself both as a professional and as a person to empathize with the user
- **Contacts**: this is the final section where I provide various options to contact me

## Used technologies

The site is written in **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** with the use of **Bootstrap** as a CSS framework and **jQuery** as a Javascript library. Bootstrap was only used to define the layout, I did not use any of its components. Could I have done without using it? Yes, but I was curious to try it to see how it worked because I had never done it before.

As for jQuery, I used it to make my life a little easier with Javascript and make the code more beautiful to look at. This was also the first time I used it and I must say that it is very convenient, a good alternative to classic Javascript and frameworks that in projects like this would have been unnecessarily overkill for a simple landing page with few features

I used an external service for managing the form, **Formcarry**, which is very convenient. They also provide pre-made forms that I did not use because I preferred to make them myself. I used the free version which is more than fine for now. In the future I could also design a server that manages these requests with a dashboard that reflects my needs but, time will tell.

The design was conceived as Desktop-First and then adapted to Mobile. The only reason for this choice was that the idea I had for the layout was more similar to desktop use and in my opinion it was nicer to look at

The images, icons, logos and all the illustrations were made by me (that's why aren't the best). I'm not a graphic designer so I understand very little about this stuff and I spent a ludricous amount of hours to do things that an expert would have done in 2 minutes, but my goal was to give life to a "creature" entirely made by me even if imperfect

These choices were also made to save money. Starting with the business now, I actually don't have a penny to invest in it, and this also pushed me to use GitHub Pages for hosting the site. When the business grows and I can afford more independent solutions I will do it but for now I'll make do with this

## Major issues and solutions

Since it's actually my first real project that I have designed, coded and published, the challenges I encountered were many, I'm convinced and happy with some things but there are also some things that don't fully convince me (aesthetically speaking)

### Biggest problems:

- The Design phase was the longest and most destructive. The hours spent in this phase perhaps reach 90% of the total while the remaining 10% includes the code and other little things. Not that I was amazed by since writing code is what I studied at university while for design it was my first approach. Even though I hadn't used certain technologies in the past (pure HTML, CSS and JS with Bootstrap and jQuery), I was able to adapt quite quickly but with the design it wasn't like that

- I had a lot of problems with colors and contrasts. When I started the project I didn't know anything about the topic that was discovered by me when the work was already underway so this thing is far from being perfect

- What made me waste the most time was the lack of organization of my work, not so much as "hours in the day" but as design-code sequencing. I started writing the code without having finished the design first (I can't hold back when I have to write code), so at every design change I had to go back to the code over and over again and change what I had done up to that point. I extended the times at least three times.

- Another thing I didn't do that I regret was versioning, I didn't implement it from the beginning, I don't know why, don't ask me. I completely forgot.

### Possible solutions:

- Take a design course that I will start once I upload this site online. I lack the basics so I will start with those also because UI and UX are topics that interest me a lot and I want to delve deeper. Another reason why I want to study this is to offer the best to my clients, I need to be more efficient, do things correctly and in better times

- If I don't finish the Design phase the code cannot be touched. I'm sure that this will make me go faster, making all the decisions at the beginning and then going fast until the end

## What's next

After this I will start working on the next project, an iOS app to track gym workouts and the progress made. I chose to make it as an iOS app because I want to take a break from the web development ​​to brush up on my knowledge of mobile programming. I will start using Swift, SwiftUI again and finally I will be able to try Swift Data which seems to be more mature and suitable for at least small projects. If that is not enough, in any case it integrates well with Core Data so there should not be too many problems.
